# and niri were REMOVED 2026-09-12 — GNOME + gemshell + console are the
# supported set. (gemwl/services/desktop.nix remains in-tree but is

  #   - extraLocaleSettings pins every LC_* category to GB as well, so a

  # NOT run setfont — TER16x32 is a KERNEL fbcon font name, not a kbd
  # consolefont, so setting it here made setfont exit 66 and the unit
  # fail (phase-2 TODO P2). The kernel font (what the LCD shows) is

  # device-only busybox .bkmap binary from the Debian rootfs is NOT
  # needed; loadkeys --validate passes on the text map).

  # pkgs/mesa-geminipda.nix is a thin override of the pinned nixpkgs
  # Mesa 26.2.2 (panfrost + the T880 polygon-list delta), wired as
  # hardware.graphics.package. hardware.graphics then supplies the single
  # glvnd ICD (/run/opengl-driver/share/glvnd/egl_vendor.d/50_mesa.json,
  # absolute library_path baked in) plus the DRI/GBM driver dirs;
  # libglvnd supplies the client libs (libEGL.so.1 / libGLESv2.so.2) that
  # dispatch to it. This replaced the old setup (hardware.graphics
  # unintendedly ON *and* a fork /etc ICD), where glvnd loaded BOTH mesa
  # 26.2.2 and the 25.0.7 fork in one process — a compositor had
  # libgallium-25.0.7 + libgallium-26.2.2 loaded at once and could not
  # import buffers between them ("import for wrong devices"). Receipts:
  # docs/handover-2026-09-10-gnome-perf-touch.md, docs/library-deltas.md.

  # aarch64 deb — arm64 Linux stable only ships since ~2026-07, and the
  # repo's nixpkgs pin already carries it with aarch64 support; unfree,
  # allowed above) + Firefox 155.0.1. Both go through the SAME client GL
  # path the Debian rootfs verified (Firefox WebGL worked there on the
  # fork mesa): nixpkgs' firefox wrapper ships libglvnd on LD_LIBRARY_PATH
  # (withGlvnd defaults true on Linux), so its dlopen of libEGL.so.1
  # dispatches via the /run/opengl-driver 50_mesa.json ICD above ->
  # mesa-geminipda (26.2.2) -> panfrost renderD128. Two gaps had to
  # close first (both 2026-09-08, on-glass failures): (1) the fork was
  # built with NO wayland EGL platform (-Dplatforms=) so browser GL had
  # no display path at all — pkgs/mesa-geminipda.nix now builds
  # surfaceless,wayland; (2) the fork libgbm needs GBM_BACKENDS_PATH to
  # find dri_gbm.so (browser glxtest GPU probe). Firefox must be
