# Gemini PDA Wi-Fi (rootfs side).
#
# Ports the verified Wi-Fi stack from the GeminiPDA project
# (build/rootfs-files/wifi/ + build/rootfs-files/wifi-consys/) into the
# NixOS system. Two independent radios:
#
#   INTERNAL — the on-die MT6630 CONSYS: mtk_wcn (WMT core) +
#   wlan_gen3 (vendor gen3 802.11 host stack) + the debugfs pwr-on that
#   runs the full WMT vendor init (hw_check -> ROMv3 patches ->
#   STP_RDY -> FUNC_ON -> wlan0). gemini-wifi-internal.service brings the
#   kernel stack up at boot. Load ORDER matters: wlan_gen3 must be
#   loaded before the pwr-on (a func-on with no wlan registered returns
#   -2 and powers the chip back down — B-33), and the whole unit runs
#   AFTER gemini-gpu-poweron (the CONSYS chip's chrdev, major 226,
#   collides with the GPU's chrdev if the wlan modules probe before the
#   GPU power-on sequence — handover-2026-09-07).
#
#   USB — the 0bda:c811 RTL8821CU dongle: rtw88_8821cu (udev
#   auto-loads it when the dongle is plugged in; the firmware is in the
#   gemini firmware package).
#
# [changed 2026-09-10] CONNECTIVITY MANAGER = NetworkManager by default
# (services.geminiWifi.useNetworkManager). The DE status bars / wifi
# pickers (GNOME, nm-applet/nm-tray, …)
# all talk org.freedesktop.NetworkManager; the old bring-up stack drove
# wlan0 with a standalone wpa_supplicant + dhcpcd (`wifi` CLI +
# gemini-wifi-auto), which no desktop can show or control. NM owns
# wlan0 (CONSYS) and the dongle's wlan1 through its wpa_supplicant
# backend; the CONSYS bring-up UNITS above stay exactly as they are
# (chip power + stack init are kernel-adjacent, not NM's job). Saved
# networks move from /etc/wifi/profiles.conf (legacy CLI store) to NM
# connection profiles (networking.networkmanager.ensureProfiles below).
# The `wifi` CLI + dhcpcd stay installed for diagnostics / the
# standalone fallback (useNetworkManager = false restores the old
# auto-connect unit). usb0 (g_ether) is unmanaged — the static host
# link config in config/gemini.nix owns it (see below).
#
# Factory NVRAM — the gen3 driver reads /data/nvram/APCFG/APRDEB/WIFI
# at probe for the MAC + TX calibration; /data is a tmpfs (kept out of
# the rootfs image, as on the verified device), so
# gemini-wifi-nvram.service installs the factory record before the
# internal stack comes up.
#
# g_ether (usb0, 10.15.19.82) is the host link — Wi-Fi never touches it.
