# Vanilla GNOME on the Gemini PDA — the standards path.
#
# This is the desktop that becomes possible once the LK framebuffer is a
# real DRM/KMS device (devices/planet-geminipda/kernel/delta/drivers/gpu/
# drm/tiny/geminipda-drm.c -> /dev/dri/card0).  With a normal KMS device
# there is no reason to hand-roll a session: this module uses the
# ORDINARY NixOS GNOME modules (services.xserver.desktopManager.gnome +
# GDM), exactly as on a laptop.  That is the whole point of the KMS work —
# no bespoke compositor, no nesting, and future GNOME releases keep
# working.
#
# Relationship to the nested gemwl desktop (services/desktop.nix):
#   gemwl owns the raw LK framebuffer through /dev/gemfb.  GNOME needs
#   the whole screen and a logind seat, so it REPLACES that stack: this
#   module force-disables gemwl.  The two modes are mutually exclusive
#   by construction; enable exactly one.  [The nested LXQt and Phosh
#   sessions that used to host on gemwl were removed 2026-09-12.]
#
# Why GNOME is off by default: it needs /dev/dri/card0, i.e. the
# geminipda-drm module in a NEW boot.img.  Booting this config on a kernel
# without that driver gives no session at all.  So the switch is a
# deliberate two-step (flash the KMS boot.img, confirm card0, then set
# services.gnomeDesktop.enable = true) — see docs/gnome-feasibility.md.
#
# X11/Xwayland: the session is Wayland-native.  GNOME 50's mutter has no
# X11 backend at all (the X11 and nested backends were removed), so no
# Xorg is used; Xwayland is built into nixpkgs' mutter but is only
# started on demand for X clients, of which this image has none.  (A
# mutter built with -Dxwayland=false would remove it outright; not done
# here because the pinned nixpkgs' mutter is shared with the pinned GNOME
# packages.)
#
# GPU: panfrost is blacklisted at boot (services/gemini-pda.nix) because
# an early probe on the un-powered Mali soft-resets.  In the nested stack
# gemwl.service loads it in ExecStartPre; with gemwl disabled this module
# owns that step, ordered after gemini-gpu-poweron and before GDM.

        The Gemini PDA displays through two DRM devices: panfrost
        (/dev/dri/card0 + renderD128; the Mali GPU, no display) and
        geminipda-drm (/dev/dri/cardN; the LK framebuffer as KMS, no GPU).
        Mesa's kmsro layer is compiled into pkgs/mesa-geminipda.nix (it is
        auto-enabled because panfrost is a renderonly driver) and pairs the
        display-only KMS card with panfrost for rendering: Mesa's
        pipe-loader falls back to the kmsro driver for the unknown
        "geminipda-drm" name, and kmsro_drm_screen_create() calls
        pipe_loader_get_compatible_render_capable_device_fds(), which pairs
        any PLATFORM display-only device with a platform render driver
        (panfrost).  The result is a hardware-accelerated EGL screen whose
        GL_RENDERER is "Mali-T880 (Panfrost)", so mutter
        (meta-render-device.c: anything not llvmpipe/softpipe/swrast is
        "hardware accelerated") selects geminipda-drm as its primary GPU
        (it is the GPU with the built-in DSI panel) and renders through
        panfrost.  Setting this option forces llvmpipe instead and throws
        that away; it exists only to get a session up if kmsro ever fails

    # Why the bindings are raw KEYCODES, not the XF86 keysym names:
    # mutter's accelerator parser supports <Mod5> (meta-accel-parse.c

    # (add_keysym_keycodes_from_layout() stops at the first level with a
    # match).  The compiled gemini keymap has XF86AudioLowerVolume/etc at
    # level 0 on the standard evdev consumer keycodes (<VOL->=0x7a,
    # <MUTE>=0x79, <I232/233>), so `<Mod5>XF86AudioLowerVolume` binds to
    # (0x7a, Mod5) and never matches the Fn event (keycode 0x36 = C,
    # Mod5).  Verified on glass 2026-09-10p: `<Mod5>0x39` (N) raised the
    # backlight, the keysym form did nothing.  So bind the Fn layer's
    # xkb keycodes directly — Fn+C=0x36, Fn+V=0x37, Fn+B=0x38, Fn+N=0x39,
    # Fn+T=0x1c; the transport keys Fn+Q=0x18, Fn+W=0x19, Fn+E=0x1a (xkb
    # keycode = evdev code + 8; see config/xkb/symbols/gemini for the
    # level-3 keysym assignments — Fn+Q=XF86AudioPlay,
    # Fn+W=XF86AudioPrev, Fn+E=XF86AudioNext).  A device with a fixed
    # built-in keyboard only: the keycodes *are* the layout contract.
    #
    # Brightness lives in gnome-shell's keybinding schema (GNOME 50 moved

    # `<Mod5>XF86AudioPlay` etc would resolve to the standard consumer
    # keycodes at level 0 just like the volume keys, hence the raw
